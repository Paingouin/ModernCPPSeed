## Informations
I refuse to support Apple anymore. Their policies are more and more aggresive toward devellopers. I canno't spend my time to support the "Apple only rendering pipeline, Apple only cu architecture etc"... 
I blog from a fellow roguelikedev who made a good summarry: https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2019/09/sorry-mac-users-apple-doesnt-care-about-us-devs/

## Build Tools
Inside Tools/Builders

## Hot-Loading (Windows Only for the moment)
To test the hot-loading, compile the batch-hot-loading, launch it manually (in the folder build/bin/Debug) and let it run.
Open the project ofHotLoad
Change the content of the method loadedFunction and build the project.
The changes should appear.
